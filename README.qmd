## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

Installing necessary packages

```{r}
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("palmerpenguins")
gitcreds::gitcreds_set() # had to generate new token to allow comm between R and Git
```

calling necessary libraries with functions need to use

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
excel_sheets("globalchange-project.xlsx")
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

Reading in (messy) data then tidying up

```{r}
data <- read_xlsx("globalchange-project.xlsx")
data
data2 <- read_xlsx("globalchange-project.xlsx", range = "B1:M22")

data3 <- bind_rows(read_xlsx("globalchange-project.xlsx", range = "B1:M11"),
          read_xlsx("globalchange-project.xlsx", range = "B15:M22"))
```
